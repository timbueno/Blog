			 <p>When I started this blog, my intention was to resist the urge to use it as an outlet for complaining. The tech commentator world is full enough of that already and I don’t need another space to vent.</p>
<p>BUT. I’ve got a bone to pick with one specific iOS bug that’s bothered me for years and yet I’ve never seen anyone else mention it:</p>
<p>When Notification Center presents itself, notifications are briefly shown with square corners before re-rendering with rounded corners.</p>
<p>This issue has happened daily for over a year now and through multiple major iOS updates.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this with the same frequency as me? What’s your pet bug that kills you inside?</p>
<p>Someone send help. 😅</p>

			 <p>Scavengers Reign on Max is an amazing piece of Sci-Fi. Do not miss this show. I’m so happy I started watching this and cannot wait to finish it.</p>

			 <p>I’m excited for Apple to update messages to included the RCS spec. However, I fully expect them to implement some minimal functionality that keeps iMessage the superior experience.</p>
<p>I don’t think the green bubble stigma is going away anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>I planned on reading 20 books this year. I’m not sure I’m going to reach this goal. I know it’s not a big deal but it bums me out to miss this goal for the first time in years. 🫤</p>

			 <p>I’m really enjoying Puzzmo, Zach Gage and Orta Therox’s new puzzle service that’s taking on the likes of the NYT crosswords and related games. The interface is slick and I love being able to play and compete with my friends and family.</p>
<p>How many Moms are on Puzzmo besides mine? 😂</p>

			 <p>I have next to zero interest in the little AI pin that Humane is putting out. I fail to see its benefits over the devices we already have strapped to our wrists or in our pockets. I welcome the competition but it’s an uphill battle for sure. Who is the target market for this? Will I ever see one in the wild?</p>

			 <p>I bought an M2 Max MBP earlier this year. I was initially bummed that the M3 Max seemed like a significant leap forward but got over it quickly as even the M2 Max is overkill for my use case.</p>
<p>Today, I learned that the new MBPs charge at 140W over USB-C and I’m back to being a bit salty. 😅</p>

			 <p>Recently, folks have been sharing their default apps in a bunch of different categories. (I’m told the podcast <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com/">Hemispheric Views</a> started this. I plan on listening soon.)</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for learning about other people’s workflows and seeing how I can make better use of my time, so this was right up my alley.</p>
<p>In recent years I have drastically simplified the amount of third party apps I use. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel of finding and using the latest mail client, RSS reader, to-do list, etc.</p>
<p>I still keep my ear to the ground about the hot new productivity app but I have to be really sure it’s sticking around before I swap away from the default Apple option. Apple’s apps don’t always have the latest flashy features but I generally expect them to be around for the next five years.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here are my default apps:</p>
<p>📨 Mail Client</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Mail</li>
</ul>
<p>📮 Mail Server</p>
<ul>
<li>GSuite (Is it still called this? I’m considering switching to FastMail but haven’t pulled the trigger yet.)</li>
</ul>
<p>📝 Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ To-Do</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Reminders</li>
</ul>
<p>📷 iPhone Photo Shooting</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Camera</li>
</ul>
<p>🟦 Photo Management</p>
<ul>
<li>iCloud Photos / Apple Photos</li>
</ul>
<p>📆 Calendar</p>
<ul>
<li>Fantastical</li>
</ul>
<p>📁 Cloud File Storage</p>
<ul>
<li>iCloud Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>📖 RSS</p>
<ul>
<li>N/A (I used Feedbin after the death of Google Reader but I no longer use RSS much at all anymore.)</li>
</ul>
<p>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>🌐 Browser</p>
<ul>
<li>Safari / Firefox / Chrome in that order.</li>
</ul>
<p>💬 Chat</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Messages and one Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>🔖 Bookmarks</p>
<ul>
<li>N/A (I usually save links in Apple Reminders or Apple Notes, depending on the context.)</li>
</ul>
<p>📑 Read It Later</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deadpan.io/ephemera">Ephemera</a> (This one is my app. It’s simple and unique. Check it out!)</li>
</ul>
<p>📜 Word Processing</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Notes / TextEdit / Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>📈 Spreadsheets</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers (I would use Excel in a heartbeat if I had any services spreadsheeting to do.)</li>
</ul>
<p>📊 Presentations</p>
<ul>
<li>N/A</li>
</ul>
<p>🛒 Shopping Lists</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>🍴 Meal Planning</p>
<ul>
<li>Mela</li>
</ul>
<p>💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>📰 News</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple News</li>
</ul>
<p>🎵 Music</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Music</li>
</ul>
<p>🎤 Podcasts</p>
<ul>
<li>Overcast</li>
</ul>
<p>🔐 Password Management</p>
<ul>
<li>1Password (Thinking about switching to the native keychain implementation, but I’ve got my family on the 1Password family plan and it sounds like a pain in the butt for me to switch.)</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am going to try posting a bit here. I have always struggled to keep a blogging routine. My plan is to treat it a lot more causally than I have in the past.</p>
<p>Let the fun (and posting) begin!</p>
